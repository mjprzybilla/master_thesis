This repository was created to store and provide all scripts used in the master thesis "Modelling cancer evolution *in vitro* using tissue-derived gastric organoids". This includes the scripts for generation of all figures and for the analyses implemented. In line with the structure of the thesis, the scripts are split according each individual chapter. 

As the datasets are not available before publication, only the analysis scripts are provided. However, once the data are publicly available, this repository will be linked here.
