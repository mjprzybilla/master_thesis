This repository was created to store and provide all scripts used in the master thesis "*Modelling cancer evolution in vitro using tissue-derived gastric organoids*". This includes the scripts for generation of the Figures and analyses implemented split according to chapters. 

As the datasets are not available before publication, only the analysis scripts are provided. However, once the data are publicly available, this repository will be linked here.
