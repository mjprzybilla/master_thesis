This repository was created to store and provide all scripts used in the master thesis "Modelling cancer evolution *in vitro* using tissue-derived gastric organoids". This includes the scripts for generation of all figures and for the analyses implemented. In line with the structure of the thesis, the scripts are split according each individual chapter. 

It should be noted that several scripts are currently not included as they are crucial parts of the analysis pipelines developed by Karlsson and colleagues. This criterion is meet for the scripts for the hashtag and expressed cellular barcode system (ECB). Therefore, they will not be made available here, but can be found on the Github page upon publication of the manuscript “Genotype-phenotype mapping of tumor initiation at single cell resolution in gastric organoids”. Similarly, the datasets used for this thesis will be provided then. However, once the data are publicly available, the respective data repository will be linked here as well. 

In addition, scripts for running the cellranger pipelines for [scRNA](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression) and [scDNA](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-dna) were not included here, as they are simply mirroring single line bash commands from the 10X analysis pipeline.
