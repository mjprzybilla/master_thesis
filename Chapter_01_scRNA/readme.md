# Assembling a computational workflow for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis

**scRNA_01_Seurat_ECB.R** - Script to analyze and process the single cell RNA sequencing data containing hashtag and ECB information.

**scRNA_02_Seurat_Hash.R** - Script to analyze and process the single cell RNA sequencing data containing hashtag information only. This script is used to generate Figure 10.
